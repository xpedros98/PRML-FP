# PRML final project

## Requirements
 - All .py files from the repo must be saved in the same folder.

 - To execute the main.py, a folder called "Data" (with all the .tcx files desired to convert to .csv), and another folder called "Outs" (where all converted .csv files will be stored) must exist in the same folder as the main.py.
