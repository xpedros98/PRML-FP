# PRML final project
This repository contains the complementary programs commented on the final project report as well as the data needed to run them. The files correspond to:
 - auxiliar_fucntions.py: there are auxiliar functions to convert and compute the data.
 - ds_creator.py: it is the main program, the only that it is needed to run in order to obtain the dataset.

## Requirements
 - All .py files from the repo must be saved in the same folder.

 - To execute the ds_creator.py, a folder called "Data" (with all the .tcx files desired to convert to .csv), and another empty folder called "Outs" (where all converted .csv files will be stored) must exist in the same folder as the main.py.
